Deep learning is an AI function that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages, and making decisions.
Deep learning AI is able to learn without human supervision, drawing from data that is both unstructured and unlabeled.
Deep learning, a form of machine learning, can be used to help detect fraud or money laundering, among other functions.
However, the data, which normally is unstructured, is so vast that it could take decades for humans to comprehend it and extract relevant information. Companies realize the incredible potential that can result from unraveling this wealth of information and are increasingly adapting to AI systems for automated support.
