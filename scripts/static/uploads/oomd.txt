Objects are composite data types. An object provides for the storage of multiple data values in a single unit. Each value is assigned a name which may then be used to reference it. Each element in an object is referred to as a property. Object properties can be seen as an unordered list of name value pairs contained within the container object. Object comes in two flavors. There are system defined objects, which are predefined and come with the JavaScript parser or with the browser running the parser. And there are user defined objects, which the programmer creates. There are two important concepts to understand when talking about objects. These are the ideas of class and instance. Creating objects is a two step process. First you must define a class of objects, then you use the object class by declaring instances of that class within the program. The object class is a definition, or description, of how the object is supposed to be created, what it contains, and how it works. The object instance is a composite data type, or object, created based on the rules set forth in the class definition.
